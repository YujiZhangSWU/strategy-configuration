The code includes the function for theoretical calculations (written in Python 3.7.4). The details for it are as follows:
# Critical ratio.py
It is used to calculate the theoretical critical ratio $(b/c)^*_{\xi}$ used in the main text. The first parameter, $G$, is the targeting network, and the second one is a list containing all nodes to be initialized as cooperators. It outputs the corresponding critical ratio. The example in this file illustrates calculating the critical ratio, where node $0$ represents a single cooperator and all other nodes are defectors in the initial stage.
